# üöÄAbout Me

I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan specializing in Software Development. 

In my free time I love to work on apps for IOS using Swift and SwiftUI. An app I am currently working on is called Hungry!. It is a hunger mindfullness app that I plan on submitting to the IOS app store. I currently have one app on the App Store called Speed!. Which is a Rubik's cube timer app, where you can track and share your solves!
